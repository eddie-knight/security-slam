The CNCF Technical Advisory Group for Security & Compliance is excited to announce the upcoming 2026 Security Slam at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe, in partnership with Sonatype, OpenSSF, and OSTIF.

The event runs from **Friday, February 20th** until **Friday, March 20th, 2026**. The Slam is designed to help projects understand and improve their high-level security posture. Now on its fifth iteration, the Security Slam has taken many shapes over the years; this year follows the format that had the most statistically significant results: a month-long effort with a library of support resources, advisors on Slack, and plaques and badges for participating projects and contributors.

**Key dates:**

- Friday, February 20: Event objectives announced; Slam Library opens
- Friday, March 20: Final scoring submissions close; scoring begins
- Thursday, March 26: Awards on the KubeCon Project Pavilion Stage

Projects from outside the CNCF and Linux Foundation are invited to participate. If your project is published to LFX Insights by the closing date, you qualify to receive Slam recognitions. Pre-registration is open—sign up to receive reminders and instructions.
