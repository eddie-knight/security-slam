## Challenge

Complete all OSPS Baseline controls related to project documentation

## Why?

We get it. Documentation doesn't _feel_ like security work. You're not hardening systems, you're not patching vulnerabilities, you're not implementing the latest cryptography.

But here's the truth that industry experts have learned the hard way: good security practice is always preceded by good documentation. We just want to be more structured about what that documentation includes.

Because this is how you:

- Communicate security expectations to contributors
- Demonstrate security practices to adopters and auditors
- Create institutional knowledge that survives team turnover
- Enable others to reproduce and verify your security claims
- Make intentional decisions instead of reactive ones

You can build a beautiful house... but if you don't lay a solid foundation, everything else will slowly deteriorate or it could suddenly crumble around you at any moment.

## How?

The OSPS Baseline includes several documentation-focused controls. To earn the Chronicler badge, you'll need to complete all of respective to your project's maturity level.

If you're at Maturity Level 2 or 3, start with the lower levels and move up.

When you get to working on the Cleaner badge, we'll compile the documentation locations for users to more readily find.

While you're working, remember: A short, accurate doc is infinitely better than a comprehensive document that nobody maintains.
