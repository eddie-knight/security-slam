## Challenge

Complete all OSPS Baseline controls related to project documentation

## Why?

We get it. Documentation doesn't _feel_ like security work. You're not hardening systems, you're not patching vulnerabilities, you're not implementing the latest cryptography.

But here's the truth that industry experts have learned the hard way: good security practice is always preceded by good documentation. We just want to be more structured about what that documentation includes.

Because this is how you:

- Communicate security expectations to contributors
- Demonstrate security practices to adopters and auditors
- Create institutional knowledge that survives team turnover
- Enable others to reproduce and verify your security claims
- Make intentional decisions instead of reactive ones

You can build a beautiful house... but if you don't lay a solid foundation, everything else will slowly deteriorate or it could suddenly crumble around you at any moment.

## How?

**First, create your Security Insights YAML file** (see the [Cleaner badge](/library/cleaner)) with basic information if you haven't already. You can complete that badge even without all your documentation in place yet.

The OSPS Baseline includes several documentation-focused controls. To earn the Chronicler badge, you'll need to complete all of the requirements respective to your project's maturity level.

If you're at Maturity Level 2 or 3, start with the lower levels and move up.

**As you create each piece of documentation, add its location to your Security Insights YAML file.** This makes it easy for evaluators and end-users to find all your security documentation in one place.

While you're working, remember: A short, accurate doc is infinitely better than a comprehensive document that nobody maintains.
