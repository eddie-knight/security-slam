## Challenge

Demonstrate robust completeness with the OSPS Baseline for your project's maturity level

## Why?

This is what we're all working toward in this Slam.

The culmination. The complete package.  The _magnum opus_.

The Inspector, Chronicler, Cleaner, and Mechanizer badges are stepping stones. Each one builds capability and demonstrates progress.

The Baseline is a minimum standard of what actually works in production open source projects, and any of our projects should be able to accomplish it with some dedicated effort.

The Defender badge lets you go up on a roof and shout about it when you finish.

## How?

The path to Defender depends on your project's maturity level. If you're just starting out, you're working toward Maturity Level 1 (ML1). If you've been around longer and have more resources, you might be targeting ML2 or ML3.

### The Journey

1. **Know your maturity level**: Review the [OSPS Baseline maturity level definitions](#) to understand where your project sits
2. **Complete the stepping stones**: Work through Inspector, Chronicler, Cleaner, and Mechanizer badges to build your foundation
3. **Fill the gaps**: Use the [Baseline controls documentation](#) to identify any remaining controls for your maturity level
4. **Document everything**: Make sure your completeness is visible and verifiable
5. **Get evaluated**: Submit your project for Slam evaluation

### What "Complete" Means

Complete doesn't mean perfect. It means you've addressed all the baseline controls applicable to your maturity level. Some controls require specific implementations. Others require documented decisions and trade-offs.

The key is demonstrating that you've considered each control, implemented what makes sense for your project, and can articulate why you made the choices you did.

### Getting There

This is a marathon, not a sprint. Most projects don't complete Defender in their first Slam. That's okay.

Use this Slam to make meaningful progress. Work with your Slam Advisor when you get stuck. Learn from the other projects in your cohort. Celebrate the badges you do earn along the way.

The Defender badge will be waiting when you're ready.
