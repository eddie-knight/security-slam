The Security Slam is a CNCF community activity run by the Technical Advisory Group for Security & Compliance. Now in its fifth iteration, the Slam helps projects understand and improve their high-level security posture.

"Security hygiene is something every project should do—and every project can do it with a bit of guidance. It's everyday stuff, like the equivalent of brushing your teeth. After you learn it once, you can easily do it every day." — Christopher "CRob" Robinson, OpenSSF CTO & Chief Architect

## Key dates

- **Friday, February 20, 2026** — Event objectives announced; Slam Library opens
- **Friday, March 20, 2026** — Final scoring submissions close; scoring begins
- **Thursday, March 26, 2026** — Awards on the KubeCon Project Pavilion Stage

## 2026 format

The 2026 event runs approximately one month (February 20 – March 20), leading up to KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe. Key elements:

- **Slam Library** — A library of support resources (hosted on this site) to accelerate execution of the more complex goals
- **Advisors** — Available via a dedicated CNCF Slack channel all month for clarifications and questions on security hygiene
- **Plaques & badges** — Participating projects receive custom plaques; individual contributors receive badges corresponding to the project's completed goals
- **Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)** — Advisors and material will be available on CRA this year

## Who can participate

Previously restricted to CNCF projects, the Slam now uses the LFX Insights dashboard: if your project is published to LFX Insights by the closing date, you qualify. Projects from outside the CNCF and Linux Foundation are invited to participate.

## Partners

The 2026 Security Slam is in partnership with Sonatype, OpenSSF, and OSTIF.

## History

Past events have included incentives such as Google's 2022 donations for milestone-reaching projects or the 2025 LEGO prizes for top contributors. The 2023 event gave projects iron-on badges and framed plaques; that format had the most statistically significant results and inspired this year's structure. Maintainers have reported real wins—for example, work done during a prior Slam (pinning workflow versions) paid off when a GitHub action was later compromised.
